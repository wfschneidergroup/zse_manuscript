	shorttitle = {The interaction of bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase with hydrogen peroxide},
	abstract = {Bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase was slowly and irreversibly inactivated by hydrogen peroxide. The rate of this inactivation was directly dependent upon the concentrations of both H2O2 and of enzyme, and its second-order rate constant at pH 10.0 and 25 degrees was 6.7 M-1 sec-1. Inactivation was preceded by a bleaching due to rapid reduction of Cu2+ on the enzyme, and following this there was a gradual reappearance of a new absorption in the visible region, which was coincident with the loss of catalytic activity. Inactivation of the enzyme was pH-dependent and indicated an essential ionization whose pKa was approximately 10.2. Replacement of H2O by D2O raised this pKa but did not diminish the catalytic activity of superoxide dismutase, measured at pH 10.0. Several compounds, including xanthine, urate, formate, and azide, protected the enzyme against inactivation by H2O2. Alcohols and benzoate, which scavenge hydroxyl radical, did not protect. Compounds with special affinity for singlet oxygen were similarly ineffective. The data were interpreted in terms of the reduction of the enzyme-bound Cu2+ to Cu+, by H2O2, followed by a Fenton's type reaction of the Cu+ with additional H2O2. This would generate Cu2+-OH- or its ionized equivalent, Cu2+-O--, which could then oxidatively attack an adjacent histidine and thus inactivate the enzyme. Compounds which protected the enzyme could have done so by reacting with the bound oxidant, in competition with the adjacent histidine.},

	issn = {0006-2960},
	doi = {10.1021/bi00695a007},
	abstract = {Ionization effects on the binding of the potential transition state analogues 2-phosphoglycolate and 2-phosphoglycolohydroxamate appear to be attributable to the changing state of ionization of the ligands themselves, therefore it is unnecessary to postulate the additional involvement of an ionizing residue at the active site of triosephosphate isomerase to explain the influence of changing pH on Ki in the neutral range. The binding of the competitive inhibitor inorganic sulfate is insensitive to changing pH in the neutral range. 3-Chloroacetol sulfate, synthesized as an active-site-specific reagent for triosephosphate isomerase, is used to provide an indication of the pKa of the essential carboxyl group of this enzyme. Previously described active-site-specific reagents for the isomerase were phosphate esters, and their changing state of ionization (accompanied by possible changes in their affinity for the active site) may have complicated earlier attempts to determine the pKa of the essential carboxyl group from the pH dependence of the rate of inactivation. Being a strong monoprotic acid, chloroacetol sulfate is better suited to the determination of the pKa of the carboxyl group. Chloroacetol sulfate inactivates triosephosphate isomerase by the selective esterification of the same carboxyl group as that which is esterified by the phosphate esters described earlier. From the pH dependence of the rate of inactivation of yeast triosephosphate isomerase, the apparent pKa of the active-site carboxyl group is estimated as 3.9 +/- 0.1.},

              The catalytic properties of zeolites are intimately linked to the distribution and relative positions of Al atoms and defects in the pore network. However, characterizing this distribution is challenging, in particular when different local Al arrangements are considered. In this contribution we use a combination of first principles calculations and experimental measurements to develop a model for the Al-distribution in protonated SSZ-13. We furthermore apply this model to understand trends in OH-IR,
              27
              Al-NMR and
              29
              Si-NMR spectra. We use a Boltzmann distribution to predict the proton position for a given local Al configuration and show that for each configuration several H positions are occupied. Therefore a multi-peak spectrum in OH-IR vibrational spectroscopy is observed for all Al configurations, which is in line with experimentally measured spectra for zeolites at different Si/Al ratios. From NMR spectroscopy we find that the proton position leads to significant shifts in
              27
              Al-NMR and
              29
              Si-NMR spectra due to the modification of the local strain, which is lost when a uniform background charge is introduced. These findings are supported by experimental measurements. Finally we discuss the shortcomings of the presented model in terms of unit cell size and the impact of adjacent unit cells.},

          , 
            
              The effect of thermal treatment of SSZ-13 on catalytic activity has been investigated by using monomolecular propane conversion as a probe reaction. Two samples with Si/Al ratios of 12 and 6 were prepared and characterized by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), N
              2
              adsorption, and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). Samples were pretreated at different temperatures: mild activation at 773 K (treatment 1) and high-temperature activation at 823, 873, 973, and 1073 K (treatment 2). The catalysts showed similar catalytic propane reaction rates within the experimental error. On the other hand, after treatment 1 the catalysts showed higher cracking selectivity than dehydrogenation selectivity by a factor of 2, while the selectivity towards dehydrogenation was enhanced for the catalysts treated at high temperatures (cracking-to-dehydrogenation ratio of {\textasciitilde}1). The change in selectivity suggests that the generation of different active sites—other than Brønsted acid sites (BAS), typically considered the active sites for hydrocarbon conversion. The SSZ-13-6 treated at 823 and 873 K showed different selectivity, without a notable change in reactivity and activation energies compared to the acid catalyst after treatment 1. After high-temperature treatments, SSZ-13-12 showed gradually decreasing activation energies and increasing selectivity toward dehydrogenation with increasing pretreatment temperature (from 823 to 1073 K). These results lead us to the hypothesis that different types of new active sites are generated in SSZ-13-12 and SSZ-13-6 samples.},

	abstract = {Water networks confined within zeolites solvate clustered reactive intermediates and must rearrange to accommodate transition states that differ in size and polarity, with thermodynamic penalties that depend on the shape of the confining environment.
          , 
            
              Aqueous-phase reactions within microporous Brønsted acids occur at active centers comprised of water-reactant-clustered hydronium ions, solvated within extended hydrogen-bonded water networks that tend to stabilize reactive intermediates and transition states differently. The effects of these diverse clustered and networked structures were disentangled here by measuring turnover rates of gas-phase ethanol dehydration to diethyl ether (DEE) on H-form zeolites as water pressure was increased to the point of intrapore condensation, causing protons to become solvated in larger clusters that subsequently become solvated by extended hydrogen-bonded water networks, according to
              in situ
              IR spectra. Measured first-order rate constants in ethanol quantify the stability of S
              N
              2 transition states that eliminate DEE relative to (C
              2

              OH)(H
              +

              clusters of increasing molecularity, whose structures were respectively determined using metadynamics and
              ab initio
              molecular dynamics simulations. At low water pressures (2–10 kPa H
              2
              O), rate inhibition by water (−1 reaction order) reflects the need to displace one water by ethanol in the cluster en route to the DEE-formation transition state, which resides at the periphery of water–ethanol clusters. At higher water pressures (10–75 kPa H
              2
              O), water–ethanol clusters reach their maximum stable size ((C
              2
              H
              5
              OH)(H

              O)
              4–5
              ), and water begins to form extended hydrogen-bonded networks; concomitantly, rate inhibition by water (up to −3 reaction order) becomes stronger than expected from the molecularity of the reaction, reflecting the more extensive disruption of hydrogen bonds at DEE-formation transition states that contain an additional solvated non-polar ethyl group compared to the relevant reactant cluster, as described by non-ideal thermodynamic formalisms of reaction rates. Microporous voids of different hydrophilic binding site density (Beta; varying H
              +
              and Si–OH density) and different size and shape (Beta, MFI, TON, CHA, AEI, FAU), influence the relative extents to which intermediates and transition states disrupt their confined water networks, which manifest as different kinetic orders of inhibition at high water pressures. The confinement of water within sub-nanometer spaces influences the structures and dynamics of the complexes and extended networks formed, and in turn their ability to accommodate the evolution in polarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity as reactive intermediates become transition states in Brønsted acid-catalyzed reactions.},

          , 
            This review addresses the most relevant aspects of vibrational spectroscopies (IR, Raman and INS) applied to zeolites and zeotype materials. Surface Brønsted and Lewis acidity and surface basicity are treated in detail. The role of probe molecules and the relevance of tuning both the proton affinity and the steric hindrance of the probe to fully understand and map the complex site population present inside microporous materials are critically discussed. A detailed description of the methods needed to precisely determine the IR absorption coefficients is given, making IR a quantitative technique. The thermodynamic parameters of the adsorption process that can be extracted from a variable-temperature IR study are described. Finally, cutting-edge space- and time-resolved experiments are reviewed. All aspects are discussed by reporting relevant examples. When available, the theoretical literature related to the reviewed experimental results is reported to support the interpretation of the vibrational spectra on an atomic level.},

Predicted zeolite structures sampled from all possible symmetries also do not explain why there are so few observed seven-membered rings. Here, we analyze the ring size distributions of predicted structures as a function of energy and density. We show that predicted structures with low density, in the range where known zeolites exist, have relatively few seven-membered rings. It appears that the constraint of proximity to the low-density edge of predicted structures is what leads to a low probability of seven-membered rings. These results suggest that low-density predicted structures are similar to known zeolites and of greatest interest as new synthetic targets.},

We assessed the quality of each descriptor by machine-learning the molar energy and volume for each hypothetical framework in the dataset. We have found that a SOAP representation with a cutoff length of 6 Å, which goes beyond nearneighbor tetrahedra, best describes the structural diversity in the Deem database by capturing relevant interatomic correlations. Kernel principal component analysis shows that SOAP maintains its superior performance even when reducing its dimensionality to those of the classical descriptors and that the first three kernel principal components capture the main variability in the dataset, allowing a 3D point cloud visualization of local environments in the Deem database. This “cloud atlas” of local environments was found to show good correlations with the contribution of a given motif to the density and stability of its parent framework. Local volume and energy maps constructed from the SOAP/machine learning analyses provide new images of zeolites that reveal smooth variations of local volumes and energies across a given framework and correlations between the contributions to volume and energy associated with each atom-centered environment.},

	abstract = {Crystalline porous materials have a variety of uses, such as for catalysis and separation. Identifying suitable materials for a given application can, in principle, be done by screening material databases. Such a screening requires automated high-throughput analysis tools that calculate structural properties for all materials contained in a database so they can be compared with search queries, grouped or classiﬁed. One important aspect of the structural analysis of materials such as zeolites and metal organic frameworks is the investigation of the geometrical parameters describing pores. Here, we present algorithms and tools to efﬁciently calculate some of these important parameters. Our tools are based on the Voronoi decomposition, which for a given arrangement of atoms in a periodic domain provides a graph representation of the void space. The resulting Voronoi network is analyzed to obtain the diameter of the largest included sphere and the largest free sphere, which are two geometrical parameters that are frequently used to describe pore geometry. Accessibility of nodes in the network is also determined for a given guest molecule and the resulting information is later used to retrieve dimensionality of channel systems as well as in Monte Carlo sampling of accessible surfaces and volumes. The presented algorithms are implemented in a software tool, Zeo++, which includes a modiﬁed version of the Voro++ library. We present example applications of our algorithms and tools using zeolite frameworks currently listed in the Atlas of Zeolite Frameworks.},

	abstract = {The arrangement of framework Al heteroatoms in zeolite lattices inﬂuences the energetics of proton siting and thus the distribution of protons among crystallographically-distinct oxygen atoms and void environments, as shown here for H-CHA zeolites of ﬁxed bulk Al content (Si/Al = 15) but varying amounts of proximal Al sites (Al-O-(Si-O)x-Al, x = 1,2) in a six-membered ring (6-MR). Stretching vibrations of Brønsted acidic OH groups give rise to composite infrared (IR) features whose shapes and integrated intensities are invariant with temperature (448–748 K) on H-CHA zeolites containing predominantly 6-MR isolated Al sites. In sharp contrast, IR peak shapes change and integrated OH areas decrease reversibly with increasing temperature on H-CHA zeolites containing 6-MR paired Al sites (quantiﬁed by Co2+ titration). Periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the four distinct OH conﬁgurations at an isolated Al site exhibit distinct vibrational frequencies and molar absorptivities, but are isoenergetic (within 10 kJ molÀ1) rendering equilibrium proton populations and OH IR spectra insensitive to temperature. In contrast, paired proton conﬁgurations differ in energy by up to {\textasciitilde}40 kJ molÀ1, with higher energy conﬁgurations having lower oscillator strengths; as a result, increasing temperatures shift proton populations toward higher energy conﬁgurations that result in a decrease in composite OH IR peak areas. First-order rate constants of protolytic propane cracking (748 K, per H+) are {\textasciitilde}12Â higher on paired than isolated protons, despite similar apparent activation energies, reﬂecting apparent activation entropies that are less negative at paired proton sites. Propane cracking rates (748 K, per g) decrease linearly with Na+ content upon partial titration of H+ sites in CHA zeolites containing 6-MR isolated sites, but decrease more strongly at low Na+ contents on CHA zeolites containing 6-MR paired sites, consistent with experimental OH IR spectra and DFT calculations evincing the preferential exchange of Na+ at 6-MR paired Al sites. These conclusions about proton proximity, founded on the interrogation of well-deﬁned and characterized CHA zeolite samples by experiment and theory, provide new insights regarding its consequences for the temperature sensitivity of OH IR spectra and protolytic alkane cracking rates in Brønsted acidic zeolites. The ﬁnding that proximal proton sites accelerate high-temperature alkane activation turnovers via non-polar transition states represents a mechanistically distinct extension of our prior reports, wherein proximal protons accelerate low-temperature alkanol dehydration turnovers via polar transition states stabilized by hydrogen bonding interactions, heralding the catalytic diversity among zeolites containing different framework Al arrangements.},

The calculation of complete ring statistics, with virtually no upper limit on ring size, becomes feasible for very large network systems. The computing time and memory usage are vastly reduced by utilizing the primitive ring properties and a four-point directing method. Various ring deﬁnitions are also discussed and analyzed in detail. Finally, examples are provided for analyzing alkali-rich regions in silicate glasses using ring statistics up to 33-membered primitive rings, obtained by this algorithm. Ó 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

An algorithm has been developed to find the cells and the rings that bound them. A thread can be imagined to pass through odd rings (rings containing an odd number of atoms) without passing through even rings. Such a thread is an algorithmic realization of an odd line, which is the only topological defect in glass or amorphous condensed matter. The topological entropy of disorder associated with these odd lines is found to be approximately 80\% of the value for an ideal tetrahedrally bonded random network of atoms for which the rings that bound the cells are statistically independent.},

The occurrence of a set of common ionic intermediates for azulene and naphthalene is qualitatively demonstrated by the similarity of their mass spectra and by the metastable transitions. Comparison of the difference of the appearance potentials for the same secondary ions in both compounds with the difference in the heats of formation for these molecules in the vapor state indicated that for each of several fragment ions appearing in the spectra of naphthalene and azulene, the lowest ionized state through which the two isomers pass has energies equal within the limits of the experimental uncertainty. These common ionic intermediates appear to be states of the C1oHs+ ions.},

In microcalorimetric experiments, both zeolites show comparable properties for the sorption of water, but they differ profoundly in their sorption of ethanol, which was negligible small in zeolite 3A compared to zeolite 5A, in spite of the much larger enthalpy of sorption of ethanol in zeolite 3A. The difference can be explained in terms of a steric hindrance preventing the ethanol molecules from entering the narrow pores of the 3A structure, with the 5A structure remaining easily accessible for both the water and ethanol molecules alike. We propose to use a size selectivity index, deﬁned as the ratio of sorption capacity of water and ethanol, to characterise the applicability of a zeolite as sorbent for drying of ethanol. The thermal effects of sorption of water in zeolite 3A was found to be a function of the nature of carrier gas, He or N2, used in microcalorimetric measurements.},

Catalytic materials were examined with respect to both their physical and chemical interactions with various substrates. The replacement of sodium cations by cesium alters the distribution of methanol thermolysis products and enhances the yield of styrene and ethylbenzene via a restricted transition-state selectivity. As identified from the 13C NMR spectra, the predominant reaction of the NaX is the dehydration of methanol to dimethyl ether followed by aromatic substitution on the toluene to yield undesirable ring alkylation byproducts. Cracking competes favorably with dehydration on the CsX, thereby reducing the yield of dimethyl ether. The restricted mobility of aromatic adsorbates on the CsX, as indicated by the NMR line shape, suggests that ring alkylation is hindered by the presence of cesium cations in the adsorption cavity which sterically restrict the formation of transition states which lead to these products.},

The observed adsorption isotherms indicated that the incorporation of zeolite NaA crystal improved the CO2 adsorption ability of carbon materials, and decreased its N2 adsorption ability. The ideal permselectivity of CO2/N2 of carbon/NaA composite ﬁlms was 6.04, higher than the ideal adsorption selectivity, probably because the small molecule of CO2 diffused faster than N2.
